### Conclusion

The sales and profit performance of the business has shown a remarkable increase from 2020 to 2021, with a significant uptick in overall sales, especially in the second year. The growth in profit, driven largely by key months like July and December of 2021, underscores the positive momentum of the business. Additionally, the performance of specific retailers and regions highlights areas of strong potential, such as West Gear and the West region, while pinpointing opportunities for improvement in cities like Omaha and Des Moines.

The dominance of in-store sales as the most effective method emphasizes the importance of physical retail strategies, though there remains considerable room for growth in the online sales channel. Understanding and leveraging top-performing product categories, such as Street Footwear, can further drive profitability and sales growth.

### Recommendations

1. **Focus on Expanding Online Sales**:
   Given that online sales were the least effective method, efforts should be made to strengthen the e-commerce platform. Investing in digital marketing, improving the online user experience, and offering exclusive online promotions could help boost this channel’s contribution to total sales.

2. **Leverage High-Performing Regions and Cities**:
   The West region and cities like Charleston and New York are proving to be key drivers of profitability. Focus on expanding operations, marketing efforts, and inventory availability in these high-performing areas. Additionally, assess the challenges in underperforming cities such as Omaha and Des Moines, and explore targeted interventions.

3. **Capitalize on Successful Product Categories**:
   The Street Footwear category has proven to be a strong revenue driver, and focusing on this category—by introducing new designs, expanding the customer base, and promoting it across all channels—will likely yield further growth. The preference for Men’s products should also be leveraged in future marketing and sales campaigns.

4. **Retailer Partnerships**:
   West Gear and Footlocker have shown outstanding performance, suggesting that partnerships with these retailers should be further nurtured. Conversely, a strategic review of Walmart’s performance is recommended to identify potential areas for improvement.

5. **Monitor and Optimize Seasonal Sales**:
   Given that certain months (such as April 2020 and July 2021) significantly outperformed others, implementing targeted seasonal promotions or campaigns during peak months could further amplify sales. Understanding the reasons behind these fluctuations (e.g., promotions, consumer behavior) will be key to replicating successful periods.

By focusing on these areas, the company can build on its strong performance and address gaps in underperforming segments, leading to sustained growth and profitability in the coming years.
